# Python for Data Science and Machine Learning

Bootcamp for python data science and machine learning

## NumPy

1. Linear Algebra library for python
    - Very important b/c almost all libraris in the PyData ecosystem rely on NumPy
1. Incredibly fast
    - Bindings to C libraries

## Pandas

Python's version of Excel or R dataframes

1. Open source library built on top of NumPy
1. Allows for fast analysis and data cleaning and preparation
1. Excels in performance and productivity
1. Built-in visualization features
1. Work w/ data from a wide variety of sources

### DataFrame

1. A collection of series that share an index
1. We'll be using 'axis=1' or 'axis=0' a lot
    - Datafram is built on top of pandas
    - Dataframe.shape is a tuple
    - (5, 4): 5 refers to rows, 4 to columns (thus 0, 1)
